Welcome to my very first GitHub repository! 🎉  
This repo is just for fun — a small **Python script** that prints my bio.  

---

## 📌 About
- 🌱 I’m learning programming and exploring new tech.  
- 🖥️ This repo is just a simple way to show my name in Python.  
- 🚀 First step on my coding journey!

## 🪙 Background
I started my career in **crypto** back in **2021**.  
Since then, I’ve been exploring blockchain, DeFi, and everything around the web3 ecosystem.

## 🎯 Future Goals
- Keep improving my coding skills.  
- Contribute to open-source projects.  
- Build something useful in the Web3/crypto space.
